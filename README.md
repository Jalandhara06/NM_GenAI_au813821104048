# Naan Mudhalvan Final Project 
## Cifar-10 Image Classification using Deep Learning CNN

## Project Overview 
- The Project focuses on creating deep learning-based image classifier using the Cifar-10 Dataset.It aims to provide users with an interactive interface for real-time image classification, enhancing user engagement and demonstrating the practical utility of  the developed system.
- 
## Problem Statement :
- Develop a robust deep learning-based image classification system using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The system should accurately classify 32x32 color images into one of ten predefined classes. The goal is to implement and optimize a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture using TensorFlow and Keras to achieve high accuracy in image classification.
